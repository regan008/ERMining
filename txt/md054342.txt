                  SYRACUSE, N.Y.
                     â€”We had a most interesting discussion to end our meeting at Cornell last evening. Most of the faculty was gathered together at supper besides our visiting committee of organization representatives. They are trying to give, in the College of Home Economics at Cornell, a particular kind of guidance; not only assistance in finding a vocation by which you may earn your living but assistance in developing your own personality and your approach to your life whatever it may be.
They are stressing the fact that education in any particular line is a tool, not an end in itself, but something which you must use to achieve a satisfactory life.
It seems to me that the position of Advisor or Guidance Officer in any school or college is going to require expert training and also very careful selection for the personality; and the individual's own balance and ability to understand and sympathize with other people is going to be of vast importance.
This is, I think, a growing field which will be open to women and challenge the best that is in any woman.
We breakfasted this morning at 7:45 and left at 8:30 for Syracuse. We have had a most interesting meeting with Workers' Education teachers from Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. We will meet with members of the committee, Sup'ts. of Schools, Labor Leaders, etc. at luncheon; and after luncheon Mrs. Morgenthau and I are starting for Fishkill. It is quite a long drive as I plan to stop and see a friend for a short time on the way but the country is so perfectly beautiful and both of us love being back in New York State. We feel that it is coming home perhaps in a wider sense than reaching your own county or house, but when you know a State as well as we do, each familiar object along the road gives you a thrill and makes you say: "After all, my own State is the one I love best."
