                  â€”As we left the Ouidas Gardens on Monday we spent a few minutes in a delightful museum, a tiny one, around one courtyard but with a charming woman as director who told us about the collections, coins, jewelry for women and men from different parts of the country, a bride dressed as they used to be and sitting in a chair as they expected her to do for three days! There were some fine manuscripts and very beautiful rugs which could have held us longer but we were due at 7:00 p.m. to visit the Governor of Rabat, Mr. Abbas Tazi. Mr. Ahmed Bennani, the Sultan's chief of protocol had arranged this call, so we could see the Governor's fine Moroccan home built by our host's uncle from materials which all came from Morocco. The marble in the courtyard is from the Atlas mountains. The three white fountains in the first courtyard with high jets of water were a contrast to the dark cedar trees, and the deepest blue evening sky I have ever seen. The walls are all fine mosaic work and the ceilings all hand carved. Many beautiful warm looking rugs seem to give the finishing touch of elegance. We were served coffee, almond milk and orange juice, and a wealth of different little cakes. Everyone is so kind and hospitable, one hopes someday to see one's hosts in the U.S. though our hospitality would be much less lavish and less interesting!
Our day ended with a nine o'clock dinner at the house of Dr. and Mrs. L. Benzaquen. He is minister of communications and he kindly asked H.R.H. Princess Lalla Ayesha to be there. I was grieved that we got lost in the fog and arrived very late but we could do nothing about it except apologize profusely.
It was a pleasant evening with which to end a most interesting day.
At 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday Ambassador and Mrs. Cavendish Cannon called on me at the hotel and I ws glad of the opportunity to renew our acquaintance which was begun in Syria some years ago.
