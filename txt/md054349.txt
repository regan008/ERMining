                     —Such a time as people have who come to Washington these days! I was about to leave for my train at 7:30 this morning and a rather forlorn looking gentleman walked into my sitting room and said "Ambassador Bingham and I got up an hour too early this morning as we still have our watches on New York time!" Knowing how a man dislikes to sit around an hour before breakfast I hurriedly asked the kitchen to provide for them as soon as possible and left them looking more cheerful.
I talked to a most interesting young man last night, Mr. Harold Stark, who is making a survey in different states on the youth situation and seems to think that he is evolving a real plan on which young people may work. Of course, Mrs. Prestonia Martin, is still anxious to see her plan based on her book "Prohibiting Poverty" tried out in a modified form, using the CCC Camps as the basis. I think there may be a great deal in her idea and perhaps some method should be found by which young people can start their lives on a simple self-supporting basis, reducing their needs to a minimum and only increasing them as the years go on. It will require education however.
An amusing thing happened just as I was leaving the train this morning—an elderly couple went down the aisle and a minute later the woman came back and said to me, "yYou are Mrs. Roosevelt, aren't you? I have been married fifty-six years to an ardenardent Republican, but I am still a Democrat and I think your husband is just about perfect." She left me and a man in the seat in front of me turned around and said, "I am an ardent Republican, but I too am deeply interested in your husband!"
I got home to find my sonJames and his wife waiting for me on my balcony and we had a pleasant lunch there together. This is their sixth wedding anniversary and as I look back over the years, they have been packed with experiences for both of them. How time flies!
