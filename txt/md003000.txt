                  
                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  â€”I went to Cedarhurst on Tuesday morning to make a speech and found that a trip to Long Island does consume a full morning.
In the afternoon I met for a short time with ten fellows of the Ford Foundation who are studying the United Nations and then attended an executive committee meeting and a full board meeting of the AAUN.
In the evening I had the pleasure of having Mr. and Mrs. Jules Moch as my guests. They were very kind to me in Paris long ago and I was very glad to have the pleasure of renewing our acquaintanceship.
On Wednesday, I made a quick trip to Philadelphia to attend a prison conference and speak at a meeting there. But I rushed back by five o'clock, so that I could have an evening of preparation for my heavy schedule of the next few days.
Election Day grows nearer and the campaigns seem to me to grow less and less effective and to have less and less real meaning for the people. One can only hope that out of the welter of words some true differences of policy emerge and the people can vote for what they really want.
A very delightful book of rhymes called the "The First Rainbow" written by IlloIlo Orleans and illustrated by Maurice Ross will be enjoyed, I think, by many young people.
From the first verse, which begins:
continuing through the stories of Adam and Eve till you come to the delightful description of Noah's Ark, the tales unfold. The last two verses which follow a description of the crowded conditions of the Ark with all the animals and birds in pairs seemed to me amusing.
How he ever stayed content I have often wondered. I am sure I would have wanted to kill off a few animals before the flood came to an end and they could be allowed to get off!
The rhymes go on through many of the Bible stories and I think will be enjoyed by young and old alike.
