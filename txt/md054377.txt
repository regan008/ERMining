                     â€”Contrary to my last experience in West Virginia, the day dawned bright and sunny and Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Pickett whom I found on the train last night, and Mr. Fletcher Collins, one of the teachers in the Arthurdale School, and I all got off at 7:20 this morning at Fairmont. We were met by Mr. Glenn Work and taken directly to his house for breakfast. Mrs. Work's little girl aged seven came down to show us her baby doll after breakfast and we were told that since the doll became a member of the family little Patty could not go to sleep without having the doll go to bed also! She was the gift of a very lovely person who came down to visit not long ago and I have often thought since how much this woman's thoughtful understanding has meant in this community. She has only been here a few times but she has provided for innumerable families in the mining region nearby, things which they wanted and needed but which they would never have asked for and could not obtain for themselves. Only her thoughtful observation translated into action obtained these things and sent them down as remembrances of her visit.
After breakfast we all drove over to Mr. Fletcher Collins' house where we were to hold a meeting with the West Virginia Committee which has accepted the responsibility of helping on the Arthurdale School. It has become necessary from Miss Clapp's point of view and mine to make certain changes and we wanted to discuss them with the committee, set the machinery in motion for a transition period and have a meeting this afternoon with the homesteaders to tell them of our decisions and discussions and get their suggestions.
I am flying back to New York tonight from Pittsburgh and hope to sleep in my own apartment tonight.
