                  â€”I am very glad that President Eisenhower is still urging a summit conference before the end of the year, and I hope he will persuade General Dede Gaulle that it is possible to have a meeting of the West's leaders this year and still prepare for it adequately.
It seems to me that there is little chance of any great decisions being made in the first conference. This is more likely to be a series of conversations through which the top leaders will gradually sound each other out and perhaps come to some methods of cooperation. It is essential that in these meetings the West should have agreed on a strong and positive policy and should know what their joint objectives are.

I have also read the manuscript of a short novel, "Strike For A Kingdom," by Menna GallicGallie, a welshWelsh author, which may be published over here this coming winter. Though it is somewhat removed from our life in similar villages in the U.S., still there is charm and interest about it and I think when it does appear many people will spend an interesting and enlightening hour reading it.
I am always interested to hear of new and young artists and I have just been informed of a concert to be given at Town Hall on the afternoon of November 3 by young Howard Aibel, an honor graduate of the Julliard School of Music. He won the Walter W. Naumberg MusicalNaumburg Foundation Award this year, so I think that anyone who is able to go to his concert will enjoy a pleasant in
