                  â€”I had a little talk on Thursday with a gentleman who thinks he has really found a way for the United States to save the world, and I am waiting now for further information on his plan, which I will submit to wiser heads than mine. I always marvel at the confidence of people who think they really have the answer to how to meet the world's problems.
Mrs. Edith Sampson and I also had a little talk in the lounge of the U.N. Thursday. She is working with the representatives of the nongovernmental organizations and I think will accomplish a great deal. She is trying very hard to make them understand that it is actually the nongovernmental organizations that are the basis of the strength underlying the U.N.
I believe that the Austrian Student Good-Will Tour to North America, which was carried out under Austrian sponsorship with the aid of American co-sponsors, is now going to broaden out and will try to go to all the Western European nations. I should think this group of students could make many friends for their country throughout Europe, though, of course, they will not be the novelty there that they were here. I hope they will have a successful trip and return not only to us in the United States but to the whole North and South American continents.
I had a letter today from Miss Blanche Delaney, who is giving a concert on Sunday evening, November 9, in the hope of raising money for charitable purposes in the Harlem area. I had to tell her that I would be unable to go that night but I am sure that many will attend this event, which is given annually.
And now in these last days of the campaign, there is a suggestion that I have been asked to bring to the attention of my readers.
A young woman told me that she and a group of her friends who are housewives have found they could easily save and give to Governor Stevenson's campaign small amounts of their household money. Although each contributed only a little, their total was a sizable sum and they sent it in to the New York radio fund.
She suggests that I pass along to all of you the thought that if a million of you save one dollar, the money is worth far more than it would be if given by one or ten or a hundred people, because it means that a million good citizens are listening to speeches and making up their minds on the evidence of what they hear.
Even if you think it is late to contribute, save a dollar and send it in, for when the campaign is over, political organizations must still go on and money is needed for their work in every state in the Union.
