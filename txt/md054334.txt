                     —Up early this morning to see some of my family off, first the young Milhollands and their small boy left by car at eight a.m.; and then my daughter-in-law and Bill. I hated to see Bill go as he is such a sweet child, but they are going on another trip abroad before long. His mother says that she might as well travel now because once Bill goes to school, they will have to stay in one place!
It took me a little while to get everybody's plans straightened out for the day, and then the dogs and I went for a ride. A perfectly glorious morning, and I was home and dressed by half past eleven.
After seeing Mrs. Helm, who is soon going away for the summer and feels she has to leave everything in order to give us the least possible trouble, I started on the day's mail with Mrs. Scheider.

                  Mr. and Mrs. Porter and three young friends of Mrs. Gray's, and Mrs. William Hard came to lunch with us. We had it out on the porch and I was glad that I had not planned to have it under the trees for there were several onimous rumbles of thunder and the marquees which had already been put up for this afternoon's garden party, were hastily taken down. Rain is coming down in buckets. I know it is much needed but I wish it had waited until five-thirty! However, this garden party can be held indoors very comfortably so I am not going to worry.
Hull House in Chicago, has just sent me a sweet little piece of pottery done by one of their young sculptors, Warren Gilbertson. Between Hull House in Chicago and Henry Street Settlement and Greenwich House in New York, I am going to have a very attractive collection of pottery some daysomeday!
At two-thirty a group of women from Baltimore—The Eutaw Place Temple Sisterhood were received and at five thirty the new Bulgarian Minister is coming to tea.
