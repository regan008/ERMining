I am sure that everyone has been going around with a lighter heart today after reading that Hitler has agreed to join the league in the discussions about the present European situation.
I have always felt that in a tense situation.,  if time could be given for everyone to discuss what was going on before they actually went to war, we might come to our senses.  Most of us are taught as children to count to 2030 before we open our mouths when we were angry, and that same lesson should apply to nations.
No one denies that the Versailles Treaty was unjust in many ways and that revisions should be made.  It is quite evident, however, that Germany has ignored the agreements under the Locarno Pact, but, it seems more profitable to talk this over than to fight it out again to an unsatisfactory finish and to have another peace built on revenge and fears.
France remembers previous invasions in this century, and no one can blame her for wanting to feel secure.  There never was a time, however, when other nations were as ready to see her point of view as they are today.
But there is a tendency also to try to be fairer to all concerned, so let us pray that a spirit of fairness and friendliness to all will actuate the League's deliberations.
This has been a busy day.
A ride this morning; luncheon with the ladies of the Senate; a visit to a rather remarkable exhibit of the Holy Land in miniature carved by hand and moved by electricitiy.  It is being shown for the benefit of the Children's Hospital.
After an hour's meeting at the women'sWomen's National Democratic Club, I went to a bazaar given by the Newspaper Women's Club, which is also a benefit for the Children's Hospital.
This was our 31st wedding anniversary and so had two or three old friends and my mother-in-law, who arrived last evening, for dinner.
