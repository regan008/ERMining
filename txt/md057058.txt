Miss Collins feels that great advances have been made in creating an understanding among different groups in the communities, but that much more remains to be done; and in that I heartily agree. I wish we could use all of our programs to improve physical health as community programs which would draw different groups in the community together for participation in healthful relaxation.
A group of officers and men from the Navalnaval hospital came in at 3 o'clock, but I was obliged to cut my usual time with them rather short, because the President and I left at a little before 4 o'clock to meet our guests, His Excellency, the Governor-General of Canada, and Her Royal Highness, the Princess Alice at the station. theyThey had been told yesterday that our Washington weather was almost summer- likesummer-like, and then suddenly we decided to have winter again, with cold and sporadic showers descending upon us!
The President and the Governor-GeneralGovernor General braved the weather in an open car. I was glad that Princess Alice and I could be more comfortable following in a closed car. We drove around for a look at the Capitol, then up Constitution Avenue and in through the Easteast gate of the White House grounds. Military honors on arrival always give a colorful touch. Then we went into the diplomaticDiplomaticreceptionReceptionroomRoom, where the Vice-PresidentVice President and the members of the Cabinet waited to be introduced to our guests.
In the evening the President took the Governor-GeneralGovernor General to the White House Correspondents' dinner, while Princess Alice and her Llady-in-waiting, Miss Vera Grenfell, went with me to the Girl Scouts' birthday banquet at the Mayflower Hotel. This party was given for the leaders of the council, and I was particularly impressed by the speeches made by the wives of foreign representatives. Girl Scouting has grown in many countries throughout the world and I think is destined to grow increasingly in the years to come, as it is fundamentally a good program for training girls in citizenship.
The Washington Choral Society is giving a concert in Constitution Hall on March 27, at which Brahms' "Requiem" and Bach's "Magnificat" will be sung. I am looking forward to this program, and also to the concert to be given by the concert band and chorus of the 
                     U. S. Navy School of Music on May 2 at Constitution Hall.
