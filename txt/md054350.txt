I always think of those who are left behind. They have the consolation in this case of a long life filled with public service—many friends to testify to the Speaker's fine character and lovable qualities, but the loneliness and loss must nevertheless be borne alone by those who loved him best. My husband felt a deep sense of personal loss besides the official one and I am truly sorry for all the Speaker's political associates as well as his family.
This morning I attended the Todhunter School Commencement. Because of the fact that our school is small we combine the last day of school and the giving out of prizes to the undergraduates with the exercises for graduation. I saw my small granddaughter get two silver cups representing on her part perfect attendance and punctuality for the entire school year, part of which is good luck, but much of which is really valuable self-discipline! Mrs. O'Day came up to speak to the graduating class and made a delightful address.
At four this afternoon I picked up my two grandchildren and we went to the train to meet their mother who has just returned from California. I left them to go home alone with her, for I remember in the days of my own childhood how annoyed I was when grown people would talk of their affairs and I was bursting to tell of my own achievements! I shall join them later however for dinner.
Last night we saw Sherwood Anderson's play called "Winterset." I missed it when it was here earlier in the winter and was glad to have this opportunity of seeing it. It is beautifully written and though I had read it, I enjoyed seeing it last night, for I think it is so well acted and so well produced.
