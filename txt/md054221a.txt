I wonder if any one else glories in cold and snow without, an open fire within, and the luxury of a tray of food all by one's self in one's own room? I realize it sounds extremely selfish and a little odd to look upon this as a festive occasion. Nevertheless, last night was a festive occasion for I spent it in this way!
The house was full of young people, my husband had a cold and was in bed having milk-toast for his supper, so I said a polite good-night to everyone and at seven-thirty closed my door, lit my fire, and settled down to a nice long evening by myself. I read things which I have had in my brief case for weeksâ€”a report on educational work in the C.C.C.CCC Camps; a copy of "Progressive Education,"," dealing with the problems of youth; the first copy of a magazine edited by a group of young people; a chapter in manuscript, and I went to sleep at ten thirty. As I haven't been to bed for weeks before one a.m., and often later, this was so unusual that I woke this morning with a feeling that I must have slept for several years!

                  To-dayToday was a grand contrast, sixteen for lunch and my guest on my right was Mr. Regan of Groton School who long watched over our boys and the boys of many other people and who is, I think, one of the best beloved masters in the school. He certainly is a very wise man and has a delicious sense of humor. One youngster who is staying with us here, remarked: "Every meal is different in this house. Yesterday we talked about philosophies of government. To-day we have talked about movies and punging!" I smiled to myself, for it would be very hard to be dull with only two people over thirty at the table, all the others bursting with youth and energy!
