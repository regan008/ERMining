                     —A day filled with a number of little things—those rather sad small errands that are the last things one can do at a time such as this in the hope of making what is at best a heartbreaking time, a little bit easier for the family.
After lunch I went over to the WP. P. A.WPA Art Project and Mr. Cahill showed me some paintings done by Mr. Sam Brown of Philadelphia, a colored painter who has developed extraordinary extraordinarilysince I saw his first paintings a year ago.
I also saw samples of posters, research in design, water colors, etchings, photographs, all extraordinarily interesting and many of them done by very young people which gives promise of an artistic future that would perhaps never have been realized without the interest which has been forced upon the government by these years of depression.
I came across a letter to—aytoday with these words: "I have reached the seventy-fourth milestone of life's journey and find the school a source of much that is worth while and that is the reason I hope you will use all your influence, with the proper ones, to establish the Hope Street School in Shrevesport, Louisiana, as a permanent institution." This school is one of the projects in adult education started under F.E.R.A.FERA and continuing under W. P.A.WPA, and it is interesting that in a state which has such a high rate of illiteracy there should be this great desire for a continuance of this work.
I sometimes think that the next four years are going to bring us more appreciation of the things of the mind because as the necessities of life are more easily achieved by the average human being, they will naturally put their energies into the appreciation and acquisition of other satisfactions.
