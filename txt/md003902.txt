                  —We arrived in Moscow Tuesday evening, and I was struck by the number of planes on the ground, most of them two engine aircaft but far more than one would see coming into New York's Idlewild or LaGuardiaLa Guardia airports.
We were met by a most efficient tourist guide who had two cars waiting. An assistant took our baggage while our special guide, Mrs. Anna LavrosLavrova, went in the car with us, pointing out various things of interest on the way from the airport. She said she had seen my husband at Yalta and that they very much liked my granddaughter, Kate Roosevelt, and found her well educated, very pretty, and very nice. To be remembered so long is a real compliment, I think.
On the first part of our trip into town we merely crawled along the road until one member of our party decided that perhaps they were going so slowly because of my age. So we queried the guide on the speed limit and discovered we might go somewhat faster. This we did, shortening considerably our trip into town.
Each of us has different first impressions of Moscow. Mine are of the tremendous amount of building going on in the two sides of the city—one through which we passed driving into town and one through which we drove after dinner Tuesday night.
The Kremlin, lighted up, is most impressive when you see it for the first time at night. The moon is on the wane, but it is was very brilliant Tuesday night, and Red Square looked very beautiful.
We got out of the car and looked into the windows of a department store which covers three blocks on one side of the square. Prices seemed to us to be very high, but certain things aren't so expensive at the tourist rate of exchange. And, of course the real cost of living must be figured in relation to the amount people earn.
