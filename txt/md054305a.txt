Such a house full of young people as we have, but it is very pleasant! My daughter and son-in-law and my neiceniece and nephew, Eleanor and Daniel Roosevelt, went off and rode most of Saturday morning, I only had an hour, so I had to ride alone and get home in time to see Miss Helen Alfred who wanted to talk over some housing problems.

                  Governor Winant of the Social Security Board and Colonel Westbrook of the Works Progress Administration came to lunch, and in the afternoon we were visited by the seniors and juniors of the Tivoli and Staatsburgh, New York, high schools. Tivoli is the village near where I lived all of my girlhood on my grand mother's place, and Staatsburgh is just five miles from Hyde Park, so these fifty odd young people had a special claim on my hospitality. After that, the national heads of various women's auxiliaries belonging to the American Federation of Labor, came in to tea and we had a little chat about some of their interests. Finally a swim with the young people and then dinner to which came Mrs. Greenway and her daughter and

This morning Mrs. Scheider and I got up and for the fourth time attended the sunrise service which takes place at seven-thirty a.m. in Arlington. It is held by the Knights Templar and at the close of the services in the Amphitheatre, they placed a beautiful cross of lillies on the Tomb.
I was home again by nine o'clock for breakfast with the family and at a quarter before eleven we all went to the Easter Service at St. Thomas' Church, after which my husband and I stopped to see Colonel Howe at the hospital.
By three o'clock the rain which had actually begun to fall about ten a.m. stopped, and the sun tried its best to struggle through. April showers are good for growing things, I know, but I am wondering how well the White House grounds are going to stand the thousands of people tomorrow.
