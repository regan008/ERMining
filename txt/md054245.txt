Back in the White House this morning a little late, but a rather hurried bath got me to breakfast at nine o'clock. At eleven I was at the Cathedral for the services held in memory of King George of England. Every seat was taken and the Diplomatic Corps was, of course, in deep mourning. It was a really beautiful service and genuine feeling seemed to pervade the church,.
I talked this afternoon for an hour with a group of thirty-three supervisors of workers' education from various states. I was impressed by the bright and intelligent faces of many of these young men and women, and how sympathetic they were in the interpretation of the various communities that they had touched. It has always seemed to me that this particular phase of education was important and at this time when so many people seem to be beset by fears of socialism and communism, it seems particularly important that the workers of our country should have an opportunity to study the labor movement and the economic problem of the day. Only through understanding can they be expected to look at questions in a comprehensive way. Our great difficulty in the past has always been that individual groups only see their own point of view and could not understand the situation as a whole. I am often surprised that we have been able to have so good a meeting of minds on many subjects, considering how little different groups know about each other. Those who are interested in the future development of this country must be interested in the education of the workers.
A large company is now gathering for thedinnerthe dinner to the Justices of the Supreme Court tonight and I must say that sometimes I have to smile as I think of all the pomp and ceremony of the White House tonight and last night's square dancing in Arthurdale with a community orchestraâ€”a piano, fiddle, banjo and mandolin! Of such contrasts is our country made.
