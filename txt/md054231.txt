Having left Washington on the midnight train after the Judicial Reception, I found myself back again in New York in the morning and I ate my breakfast alone quite peacefully. I came on to attend a meeting of the Chi Omega Achievement Award Committee. This Committee awards a prize every year to a woman who is outstanding in some field. Cecelia Beaux, Frances Perkins and Josephine Roche already have received this award. In June, an award will be made at the Society's convention when it meets at White Sulphur Springs. Accidents and colds had somewhat reduced the number of our committee but recommendations were in, and we were able to do our work and then have a pleasant hour of chat over our luncheon.
After that I started on a round of visitsâ€”my husband's mother and his aunt, Mrs. Franklin K. Lane, an old friend, and finally I picked up one of my friends and started to walk down town visa First Avenue. We went pretty fast, but I was occasionally amused to see a light of recognition in someone's eyes as we walked past. Three workmen, going home from work, gazing idly at passersby, suddenly gave me a more fixed stare, and one of them said, "That's her." I gathered this meant that he had decided that either my companion or I was a familiar sight and did not require any further designation!
Home again and a quiet tea and a long talk with Miss Helen Ferris of the Junior Literary Guild about children's books. She left one with me to read and it promises to be a most delightful story for any older child or their parents.
In the evening Mrs. Henry Morgenthau, Junior, and I went to see "Libel".." It is remarkable that a court scene can sustain interest right through three acts, but it certainly does and is well acted. We both enjoyed it very much, but were a little disappointed in the ending.
