                     —My husband and I are on our way back to Washington. We left last night on this sad journey and now we have left Colonel Howe's family to go back to their home in Fall RiverwithRiver with the sad realization that he has come home for the last time. There is a sense of emptiness that comes, when all that can be done for the person of a loved one is done, it is as though one were drained of all one's powers for a time, and yet life in its ordinary aspects must be taken up again.
I am glad it is spring, and spring in New Englandis so fresh and green, everything is coming out of its winter shell and preparing to live again. All that is passed contributes to this new fresh verdure and makes new life possible.
I often wonder if the power to love and to suffer was not given to human beings so that they might experience the kindness of others and be remind that it is the power of understanding that which others go through which is the one great lesson acquired through sorrow.
I was relieved last night to hear that my three children had flown comfortably and smoothly back to New York, and my husband said he feared they would allwaysalways remind him in the future that what we insisted would be a very uncomfortable trip turned out quite the reverse!

                  Our oldest son and his wife will meet us in New York as we go through to say goodbye for they are off to—morrowtomorrow on a three weeksweek business trip. Late this evening we will be back in Washington and to—morrowtomorrow my husband will be back at his desk and I, why, I will be receiving the Daughters of the American Revolution.
