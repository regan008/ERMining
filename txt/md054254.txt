The boys and their friends are very stimulating guests. As I dash from one occupation to another, I have stopped for several discussions. This morning I had a long argument on whether a university fulfills its duty when it gathers together distinguihsed distinguishedscholars to shed lustre on the learning of the university, but does not stress the obligation to gather in teachers who have the gift of educating youth. Someone made the statement that you could instruct many people but that did not mean that you educated them because education, of course, meant more than knowledge of any particular subject. I like to make the point that scholars and teachers are two very different things and that in the institutions which we call institutions of higher learning it seems to me we sometimes forget to give sufficient attention to the role of the teacher. The instructor is often paudpaid a very small salary and yet for the future of the country, it is certainly important that the teacher be capable of stimulating and awakening curiosity in the young people under him, otherwise the scholars knowledge remains locked in his own breast or is imparted to the world through his books, and the younger generation under his influence will profit little by contact with him.
We are in the midst of another very heavy snow stormsnowstorm and I woke to find my bedroom and even my bed itself covered with snow this morning. My neighbor at dinner last night told me that the scientist at the Smithsonian who has been making experiments in the hope of discovering the way to make weather predictions long in advance, was twitted on his prediction that this would be a mild winter when he turned up at a board meeting one hour late because of the condition of the roads leading into Washington!
