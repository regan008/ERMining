                  ALBANY, N.Y.
                     —I woke this morning to the sound of many birds chirping outside our cottage window at Hyde Park. It was a most exciting visit for Miss Cook has been adding a room to this cottage and any new building operations are always quite thrilling, I think.
We have decided to make some changes in our shop arrangements also so that I had a very busy visit but got away on a fairly early train for Albany where I met with a group of the people interested in the adult education program in the state.
This program covers many phases—recreation, parent education, nursery schools, workers education, arts and crafts, vocational education, and work with the handicapped, both young and old. It was a most interesting discussion of problems and I think the fact that New York State started its program early has given it a certain advantage and there has certainly been a fine group of people working on all the phases of the program.
On the way up, I was reading an interesting article in the "Country Gentleman" written by one of the best women reporters in Washington—Genevieve Forbes Herrick. It does not always follow that a good reporter is a good magazine writer. But in spite of a serious automobile accident and months on her back, she has now taken up her work again and if this series of articles on Washington personalities, especially women, is any indication, I think we are going to read many interesting things from her pen in the future.
Sometime when I have time hanging heavy on my hands., I am going to begin and pick out women and men in the localities that I know and write the story of individuals who actually are the inspiration of much that happens in small and large communities.
I have just had tea in the garden at the Executive Mansion with Mrs Lehman and seen many old friends in the household and soon I must get ready for a six-thirty dinner with the City Club.
