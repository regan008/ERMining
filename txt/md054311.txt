                     â€”We can, of course, think of little else to-daytoday but the loss of our old and dear friend, Colonel Howe. For over a year that he has been ill, it has been quite evident that his one great desire was to get back to the work which he had done for so many years, but his heart was not up to the spirit that would have driven him back into harness, and last night he simply slept away after having a very cheerful talk with the doctor.
There were few people for whom he really cared, but. those who had the privilege of calling him their friend knew that he could always be counted upon and there never was a more gentle, kindly spirit. He hated sham and cowardice but he had great pity for the weak and helpless in this world and responded to any appeal for help with warmth and sincerity. His courage and loyalty and devotion to his family and friends will be an inspiration to all of them as long as they live.
I spent nearly two hours yesterday morning going through Mr. J. Edgar Hoover's bureau in the Department of Justice, a most absorbing arm of the government. He told us that from five hundred to a thousand visitors go through every day and I am glad that so many young people are realizing how unprofitable crime is and how really unromantic. The detection of crime requires scientists, photographers and trained men of the highest possible calibre and there is an atmosphere as you walk through that Bureau of cooperation and alertness which-speaks well for the morale of this particular group.
In the evening my Todhunter girls who are here for the week endweekend and Mr. and Mrs. Glenn Work and their daughter from West Virginia went to see "Cyrano de Bergerac",," but I had to address the closing session of a conference on better housing held by the Washington Committee on Housing of which I am a member for the colored groups of the city.
