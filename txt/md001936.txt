The other day we read "How Fear Came" from the "Jungle Book".."

And here again is one of the human rights expressed as the law of the jungle.
So the right of privacy and the ownership of property was one of the laws of the jungle! Kipling even made it clear that in the jungle you could not be completely selfish. Here it is:
In other words, if you can get it, you can take the major part. But don't take everything or you may regret it later. And now for the last verse:
