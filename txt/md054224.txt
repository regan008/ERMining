This is the social season, so of necessity, most of my news will be on social events. Last night we gave the second, big, official dinner of the year, in honor of the Vice-President.
To this dinner come high ranking members of both political parties in the Senate and House of RepresentarivesRepresentatives, and so the Vice-President saysat on my right and Senator Borah on my left. There were eighty-eight at dinner and as the table is a large horse-shoe, the Vice-President and I had to go completely around one end in order to reach our seats opposite my husband. We had hardly seated ourselves when, with a wicked twinkle, my husband leaned forward to murmur a few things about candidacies to my left-hand neighbor!
As one woman said to me afterwards, it was a friendly dinnerâ€”everyone seemed to like his neighbor. Ambassador and Mrs. Daniels were back from Mexico and staying with us; Sir Arthur and Lady Willert, who spent many years in Washington when he was correspondent for the London Times, were also staying with us. He has since served many years in the Foreign Office in London. There were many to greet them warmly on their reappearance even here where people are quickly forgotten because they change so often.
The evening was made particularly pleasant by the artists. Lily Pons looked exquisite and sang beautifully. Mr. Totenberg played delightfully and Cornelia Otis Skinner could not have done her molonogue on "ANebraskan Being Presented at Court" to a more appreciative audience. There were guffaws from men all over the room.
Some five hundred people to tea to-day and a luncheon with Mrs. Hull, wife of the Secretary of State, and now, to more serious matters, for of course, we are all going up to Congress to-night!
