                  NEW YORK
                     —I left Washington last night on the 7 P.Mp.m. train and arrived in New York at about 11.:30, going straight home. This morning dawned clear and cool, and it was very pleasant sitting in a quiet room without any telephones ringing or any duties that waited to be preformed!
I went uptown on a bus to do some shopping and a gentleman in front of me turned around and said "I used to see you bring parties of young people to the Family Relations Court, but I haven't seen you there for sometime. It is one of the most important courts in the City, but the quarters are not adequate for our work. The Bronx and Brooklyn Courts are better housed. I hope some daysomeday we will be in Manhattan." It was crowded enough years ago when I used to go in with my class in civics—it must be pretty difficult to work satisfactorily now, for after all this Family Court is a rather private affair which depends greatly, I should think, for its success on the possibility of privacy.
I did my shopping, was back downtown at New York University on South Washington Square at one o'clock to speak to a group of students. I thought they would prefer to ask me questions, but they chose to have me talk to them first and then we had a short period of questions. They were a very patient and courteous audience, and I enjoyed my forty-five minutes with them very much. I wish I were young enough and did not have to consider so many sides of every subject. It is so much easier to be enthusiastic than to reason!
