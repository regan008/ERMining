                     â€”We are spending another day at Cornell. Having an opportunity to get the slant of some of the younger people who are students in home economics as well as meeting the staff and some of the outside people who are helping in the extension work throughout the state. It was interesting to hear one of the students say that home economics as a college was chiefly interesting because it had developed and changed in what it offered her during the four years that she had been here. That pointed to a growth it seemed to me in the faculty, which was indicative of a real institution of learning.
This morning, speaking to a group known as Family Life leaders gathered here from various communities, Miss Rose made a point which seemed to me extremely interesting. As I understood it she felt that education could be offered to individuals but that real culture was obtainable only through the approach that we as individuals brought to our experiences. These experiences could be sterile or they could become creative and cultural, dependent upon the way in which the student approached them. Of course, as we are all students every day of our lives, this is an interesting idea to bear in mind.
This afternoon the Conference Board of Women's Educational Organizations in New York State will have an opportunity to discuss how these organizations can best help with education, primarily for girls, throughout the state. I confess that my own contribution seems rather small as I am temporarily removed from the state for the greater part of the time but I would be extremely sorry not to have this opportunity of keeping up with what these women's organizations are doing and thinking in New York State.
Our work will be over this evening but for many of us I think it has seemed more a stimulating experience than a real period of work.
