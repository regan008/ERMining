An important matter that may hold up adjournment, however, and which should be taken care of before Congress goes home, is the confirmation of W. Wilson White to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Although Mr. White's nomination had been held up a long time by the Senate Judiciary Committee, it has now been approved by the committee but indications are that it will meet even stiffer opposition from Southerners when put to a vote before the whole of the Senate.
There is really no excuse to let this agency of the Justice Department go any longer without a head. And I realize I am looking at this from the point of view of a person who would like to see integration go on in the South and civil rights accepted everywhere on an equal basis.
It would not surprise me to see a delay in adjournment and a great deal of debate made on the Supreme Court question and on Mr. White's confirmation.
I was much disturbed last week endweekend by the airplane crash on Nantucket Island. I know several people who spend the summer both on Martha's Vineyard and on Nantucket, and I was deeply grateful when one of my friends called to assure me he was not on the plane that had crashed. His plane had landed only a few minutes before the tragedy, and I'm sure he must feel he has been granted a new lease on life.
It is curious how difficult it is for most of us to realize that actaully at any moment life may come to an end. It need not be on a plane. It can happen any place to any of us.
