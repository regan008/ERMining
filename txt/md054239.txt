The large official luncheon scheduled for to-daytoday was given up on account of the death of King George whom my husband had known personally. Lady Lindsay who would have been the ranking guest, will not be officially in mourning for sometime and attend no formal entertainments. Every one who knew the King seems to have a personal sense of loss, and feel that a valuable influence has gone out of international affairs.
A few out-of-town guests gathered for an informal lunch, howeverâ€”Dr. Mary Woolley, President of Mount Holyoke College sat next to me. As I looked about the table I realized that in that small group we had several states represented and a great diversity of interests. It occurred to me that everyone present had a contribution to make which the whole table should hear and I asked each one to rise, give their name, state, occupation and chief interest. This they did, and such a variety as we had! Miss Rose Schneiderman, and Mrs. Maud Swartz, represented the point of view of Labor; Mrs. Charles W. Tillett, Jr, of Charlotte, North Carolina; Mrs. Inez School, Connersville, Indiana; Mrs. Carl Pryor of Burlington, Iowa, each spoke of interests in their states; Miss Dorothy Kenyon, Deputy Commissioner of Licenses in New York City, told of her job and of her inability to ever tie herself down to any political party! Questions broke loose on international affairs, how could women best register their opinions on peace, on labor conditions, on legislation they were interested in, what was the best way of getting reliable information, and I found myself wondering if this lunch was not proof of the fact that women are more alive to government and all it implies than ever before.
