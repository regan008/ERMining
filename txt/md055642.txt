After the meeting of the Committee for the Care of European Children, I met a young friend of mine for lunch at the Biltmore Hotel to hear a sad tale of personal difficulties.
An hour at the dentist and a pleasant drive home. A cool swim, with the President joining us at the pool, and it seemed to me on the whole not such a strenuous day.
I am having an interesting experience in meeting again a woman whom I have not seen since we were girls at school outside of London. She wrote me that she was in this country visiting her daughter in Canton, New York, and that she would like to see me again. She came down to spend last night. I do not suppose that either of us would have recognized each other, but we do have many memories in common, in spite of the fact that very different experiences have come to us in the intervening years.
I am giving my final broadcast in the present series today and afterwards some of those who have worked with me, will join me at a picnic lunch at the cottage. I hope it has been as pleasant an experience to them as it has been to me. This afternoon I go back to New York City for a meeting at the YWCA, at which I have agreed to speak.
I am much grieved that I shall not be able to hear either of the concerts given by the American Youth Orchestra, leadled by Mr. Leopold Stokowski. I am sure that this is going to be a remarkably successful orchestra and I am glad that they are taking their trip to South America, for I feel it will help greatly to cement friendship between our neighbors to the south and ourselves. No one but Mr. Stokowski would have had the courage to get such a group together and give them the necessary training. I think he deserves our gratitude and deep appreciation.
