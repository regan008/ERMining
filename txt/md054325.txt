                   How differently things look from different points of view.!
A woman was telling me at breakfast this morning about her house in a mill town in Alabama, built in a row out of stucco, two rooms deep and no matter what size the family, just the same size house. There is no yard so the children must play in the streets and I am quite sure that whoever planned that mill town patted themselves on the back and thought: "Nice, clean, new little houses, much better than anything these people have ever lived in before",before," and never thought for a minute of the children in the streets, nor the lack of privacy.
This week we have had the most glorious weather and I am thankful every morning for my hour on the bridle path.
I returned from my ride this morning to see two PortoPuerto Rican women who are deeply concerned over the fact that PortoPuerto Rico was not included in the provisions of the Social Security Bill. They are here working for a change which will include their Island in this legislation and at the same time they are trying to get a social welfare department created for the Island.
After that I talked with Miss Grace Frysinger, Miss Elsie Zimmerma
                   from London, Miss Helen Atwater and Mrs. E. E. Dooley, about the meeting of the Associated Rural Women of the World, which is scheduled for the end of this month in Washington. I hope very much that this meeting may prove of great value to us in this country as well as to our visitors from other countries.
A few of the women executives in the Executive Offices of the White House and I had our annual luncheon in the garden and then I went to visit the Training School for juvenile delinquent girls in the District. But, I'll have to tell you about that tomorrow!
