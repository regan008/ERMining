Y.SYRACUSE, N.Y., Wednesday â€”I left Washington on the 1:00 o'clock plane yesterday and, on arrival in New York, I went directly to the Hotel Astor to receive a book made for me by the children of Meier Shfeyah, a self-governing juvenile village in Palestine. It was a very sweet thought and I deeply appreciate it. Then I went and did a little shopping and then back to my apartmenttoapartment to meet Mrs. Henry Morgenthau, Jr. She went to Chicago to see one of her sons last week and returned with no voice whatsoever, but in spite of that we went out last night. We dined together and went to a play. I shall have to tell you about it tomorrow, for I have several things I want to mention in this column today.
One of them is the fact that from February 18th to 25th, which is the week during which Washington's Birthday occurs, there will be the seventh annual observance of Brotherhood Week. This celebration will be particpated in by Protestants, Catholics and Jews in over a thousand communities throughout the Nation. It is so easy for hatreds and intolerances to arise when the world is in a turmoil as it is today. Those of us who are fortunate enough to be at peace, should make every effort to keep constantly before us principles which will help us to be of service when peace comes again to the whole world.
The ten good-willgoodwill resolutions which are published for use during this week, should, I think, be kept in a place where all of us can look at them day by day, and so I am quoting them here:
We left New York City this morning on a 9:00 o'clock train for Syracuse, New York. There my friend, Mr. Leo Casey, is metingmeeting us and taking us to see a housing project before he drives us to Ithaca.
