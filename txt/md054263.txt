It is amusing how well meaning people can differ on what to the uniniateduninitiated seem to be matters of fact! A short time ago I told of a conversation with two fishermen who came to see me and since then I have had a flood of letters. I was not trying to set myself up as an authority on fishing! I have listened to too many of them argue on the coast of New England not to know that agreement is as difficult in this occupation as it is in many others. But apparently both methods of fishingâ€”trapping and seining, should be allowed and a balance kept between the two. There seems to be some official opinion to back up the idea that in this way the greatest amount of employment will be made possible for the people involved. This I glean from my letters but I'm not sure the seine fishermen will agree. In addition we should all know that pink salmon has as much food value as red salmon but on the whole the letters agree that red salmon is rarer!
Now to hastily chronicle an uneventful day. It opened with sleet and wind in New York City, and I sallied forth first to inquire after a friend who is ill, then to spend a half hour with my mother-in-law in her pleasant sitting room. Another short, hazardous taxi trip for by this time the streets were growing slippery, up to see my Godmother and Cousin, Mrs. Henry Parish. A hald gourhalf hour with her and then a dash for the Pennsylvania station where my secretary and I met and took the twelve-thirty train to Washington. A dinner party at seven o'clock; Mr. and Mrs. Will Hays staying in the house with us, and the Army and Navy Reception tonight. Next to the Diplomatic Reception, it is the most colorful and gay of them all and closes the official state functions for the season. This does not mean that there are not certain social demands still made upon us, but the formal state parties are over until next December.
