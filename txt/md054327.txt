                     —This standard and daylight saving time certainly complicates my life. I wish we could all be on the same time because I never was good at arithmetic!
I went to Philadelphia this morning to meet the Democratic women and found that though I did not have to arrive there until twelve o'clock, I had to leave Washington by an eight o'clock train to accomplish this as Washington is on standard time and Philadelphia is on daylight saving time.
I rather wish I had had an opportunity to see my small grandson, who lives near Philadelphia, but I fear one's grandchildren and large groups of ladies do not amalgamate very well, so I shall have to await a visit from him in the near future.
From the station we went directly to the home of Mrs. Earle, the wife of the Governor of Pennsylvania, for a delightful luncheon. As we arrived we were greeted by a group of Girl Scouts whom I am always glad to see. After luncheon there was a reception and I made a three o'clock—standard time—train to New York where I hope to have a more or less peaceful week endweekend.
I have in my brief case a great deal of material which has to be read through during these next few days—some in preparation for a speech, one report from the Prison Industries Board, a report of one of the public housing groups, two government reports, and a manuscript on education from a gentleman who kindly sent it to me sometime ago, and I am ashamed to have had it so many weeks without giving it any consideration.
Trains are valuable to me primarily because they provide me with reading time, and I only wish that some of this reading time could be given to the books which I have piled up waiting the day when I shall have leisure hours to sit and lose myself again in somebody else's thoughts. I do assimilate a great many other people's thoughts, but they are all more or less along the same lines.
