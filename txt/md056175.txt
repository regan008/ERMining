This morning I left Washington for New York early, visited Franklin, JuniorJr., at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital, and then attended the luncheon given by the National Council on Naturalization and Citizenship at the Hotel Astor.
I have just received the following statement sent me by Mrs. Upton Sinclair and am reprinting it here because it states better than I can things I feel very deeply at the present time.
"Please hurry, Neighbor"
"No army ever did so much with so little" (Douglas MacArthur)
"But the armies of the United Nations should not have to do with so little! It is up to the folks at home to see that it does not happen again. Every soldier of the United Nations stands between you and the bombs of enemy raiders. But soldiers can not stand unless they have guns and ammunition. One dime invested in defense stamps is enough to supply five cartridges which may save a soldier's life! Save dimes and invest in defense stamps to save yourself from enemy bombs. SavedollarsSave dollars and invest in defense bonds and save our soldier's lives!
We are all neighbors in this great country and most of us newnow have someone we care about, actively defending us somewhere in the world. Surely we would not want to feel that anything we could do was left undone in giving him all the tools and services he needs.
