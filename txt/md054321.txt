We reached Washington last night at seven o'clock and at a quarter to eight, a few people came to dinner with us and immediately afterwards the Advisory Committee for the National Youth Administration met here, a group of twenty men and women, gathered together to tell the President the results of a two days conference in which they had surveyed all the work done and come to a conclusion on some recommendations for the future. The discussion was extremely interesting to me and no matter how inadequate the work may seem to some people, I can not help feeling that in every community where the work is going on there will be closer cooperation between all the agencies interested in young people, and the government through the Youth Administration, and this will be eventually of real value. They left at eleven-thirty and I was much amused for my husband had said that the could give them just an hour and as the evening progressed he came so interested that it never occurred to him that the hour allotted was long past.
This morning, Mrs. Scheider and I both realized that going away has to be paid for by facing a mountain of work and she has been trying to at least open the accumulated mail. I will have to face what she has put aside for me tonight or tomorrow so today I have been more or less vacationing.
I did spend half an hour this morning having a whole new monetary system thrust upon me in the hope that I might interest either Secretary Morgenthau or my husband, and I must say the gentleman was very interesting.
I had a group of the younger executives of two departments for luncheon and they told me their various plans and hopes for meeting difficult problems, and since then Mrs. Morgenthau and I have had a long and lazy talk. Now the Postmaster General is coming in for a minute and a number of people are coming for tea, and so the daily round goes on!
